            <h2>HISTORY OF PYTHON</h2>
            <br />
            Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming
            language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and
            developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for
            emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to
            express concepts in fewer lines of code.<br /><br />
            In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time
            when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum
            began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at
            Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the
            Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he
            was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during
            Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have
            succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with
            the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception
            handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career
            and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features.
            After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the
            syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of
            complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created
            a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The
            inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s
            Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he
            wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his
            invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent
            dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as
            the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work
            for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.<br />
            <br />
            The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it
            used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it
            with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its
            main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer
            productivity. When it was released it had more than enough
            capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data
            types exception handling and functions. <br />

            <h2>Why Python?</h2>
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python works on
            different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python has a
            simple syntax similar to the English language. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python has syntax
            that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some
            other programming languages. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python runs on an
            interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it
            is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python can be
            treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional
            way. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The most recent
            major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this
            tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with
            anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• In this tutorial
            Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write
            Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thorny,
            PyCharm, NetBeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when
            managing larger collections of Python files. <br />

            <h2>PYTHON SYNTAX</h2>
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python syntax can
            be executed by writing directly in the Command Line.<br /><br />

            <br />
            <h2>The Python Command Line</h2>
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• To test a short
            amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to
            write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can
            be run as a command line itself.<br /><br />

					   Hello, World! <br>
					   exit() <br>
              </pre>
              </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h2>
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python was
            designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English
            language with influence from mathematics. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python uses new
            lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming
            languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python relies on indentation,
            using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops,
            functions and classes. Other programming languages often use
            curly-brackets for this purpose. <br />

            containers for storing data values. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Python has no
            command for declaring a variable. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A variable is
            created the moment you first assign a value to it.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• There is a
            multiple way to declare variable in python. <br /><br />

            <h3>Rules of declaration variables:</h3>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variable can have a short name (like x and
            y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules
            for Python variables: <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A variable name
            must start with a letter or the underscore character<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A variable name
            cannot start with a number <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• A variable name
            can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9,
            and) <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Variable names are
            case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

            <br />
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be times
            when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done
            with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such
            it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
            <br /><br />
            <h4>
              Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
            </h4>
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• int() - constructs
            an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by
            removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string
            represents a whole number). <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• float() -
            constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal
            or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an
            integer). <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• str() - constructs
            a string from a wide variety of data types, including
            strings,integer literals and float literals. <br />

            Bitwise operators<br /><br />
            <h3>• Arithmetic operators:</h3>
            <br />
            Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common
            mathematical operations. Ex. + (Addition), - (Subtraction), *
            (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), ** (Exponentiation), //
            (floor division).<br /><br />
            <h3>• Assignment operators:</h3>
            <br />
            Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Ex. =,
            +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=. <br /><br />
            <h3>• Comparison operators:</h3>
            <br />
            Comparison operators are used to compare two values. Ex. ==, !=, <,
            >, <=, >=.<br />
            <br />
            <h3>• Logical operators:</h3>
            <br />
            Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. Ex.
            and, or, not. <br /><br />
            <h3>• Identity operators:</h3>
            <br />
            Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are
            equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same
            memory location. Ex, is, is not.<br /><br />
            <h3>• Membership operators:</h3>
            <br />
            Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in
            an object. Ex, in, not in.<br /><br />
            <h3>• Bitwise operators:</h3>
            <br />
            Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers. Ex, &(AND),
            |(OR), ^(XOR), ~(NOT), <<(Zero Fill Lift shift), >>(Signed Right
            Shift).<br />
